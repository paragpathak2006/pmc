# 3D Point Membership Classification
The 3D Point Membership Classification test is supposed to check if the point is inside, outside, or on the solid. 

## Ray intersection method
This can be performed using a ray intersection method in which rays are parallel to the axis and passing through the given point.

## Time complexity
The time complexity of the operation is average case O(1) when using a 2D space map data structure to store faces.
